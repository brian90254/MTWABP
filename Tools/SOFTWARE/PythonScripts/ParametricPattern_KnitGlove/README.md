# Parametric Patterning
 Parametric Knit Glove Pattern coding in Python with OpenCV visualization

 1. Clone the repro
 2. Make sure you have Python 3.9 available
 3. Create a venv in the project folder using the terminal command "python3.9 -m venv venv39"
 4. Activate the venv with "source venv39/bin/activate" from the project folder
 5. If OpenCV is not installed, type "pip3 install opencv-python" in the active environment.
 6. Run the example python script from the terminal with "python src/ParametricPattern_KnitGlove_1.py 39 52"
 7. By default, because Python 3.9 was used to create the venv, using "python" should equate to "python3.9".
 8. Check the output file, a BMP which should end up in your project directory
