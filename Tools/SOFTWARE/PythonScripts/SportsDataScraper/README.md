# Sports Data Scraper
 Python scripts to scrape sports data from the internet and format into a CSV file

 1. Clone the repro
 2. Make sure you have Python 3.9 available
 3. Create a venv in the project folder using the terminal command "python3.9 -m venv venv39"
 4. Activate the venv with "source venv39/bin/activate" from the project folder
 5. If OpenCV is not installed, type "pip3 install opencv-python" in the active environment.
 6. If Pandas is not installed, type "pip3 install pandas" in the active environment.
 6. If BeautifulSoup or lxml are not installed, use "pip3 install beautifulsoup4 lxml"
 6. Run the example python script from the terminal with "python src/ParametricPattern_KnitGlove_1.py 39 52"
 7. By default, because Python 3.9 was used to create the venv, using "python" should equate to "python3.9".
 8. Check the output file, a BMP which should end up in your project directory


Example to run this code:
- Terminal:
- - Navigate to the project folder
- - Activate venv
- - - "source venv39/bin/activate"
- - Run script, passing arguments of "year" and "week"
- - - "python src/SportsDataScraper_1.py 2023 1"
- - Output should be a CSV
