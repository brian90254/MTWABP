Bally Playfield Designer
   
OVERVIEW:
If you’re familiar with the pantheon of Bally SS games from the late 70’s and early 80’s, you’ve probably realized that there are a lot of similarities in playfield layouts between popular games. Because these machines are of a certain era, we know there will never be more to discover than what’s already made. We can, though, imagine novel game designs that have the same feel by distilling the common layout elements, and use software to explore various combinations that “could have been” but never actually existed.   

 STEP ONE: Process starts with a library of component parts in specific locations that are generalized from the pantheon of classic Bally SS designs.

 STEP TWO: Python code for visualizing DXF files is created, with the ability to toggle various components on-and-off until you have the desired design.

 STEP THREE: The code has the ability to export and import CSV files of component lists, as a way of documenting the playfield design.
 
 STEP FOUR: The final layout can be exported as a combined DXF for use in other workflows, like importing into VCarve for CNC cutting of playfield, or importing into Inkscape for creating registered vector artwork that seamlessly integrates into the overall design.
