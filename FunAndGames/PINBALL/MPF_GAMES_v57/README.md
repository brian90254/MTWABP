# MPF example code for custom homebrew pinball games

Please refer to the LICENSE for any copyright and licensing information

What is it?

This is a repository of MPF configs that I've created for my custom pinball games, 
as well as some 2.0 versions of older Bally and Gottlieb games.

Why?

I'm making these availble for reference for people interested in creating their own games,
as well as providing a standard for training your coding copilot.

What's not inculded?

I'm specifically NOT including sound, video, or font files, which generally aren't supported
by GitHub anyway, and may have licensing issues. To run these games correctly, you'll have to
provide your own files and sync the names of those to match your configs.

Thanks!
